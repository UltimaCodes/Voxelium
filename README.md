# Voxel Engine

A simple voxel engine inspired by Minecraft, written in C# from scratch with OpenTK/OpenGL. Currently, the engine allows you to generate a basic chunk, fly around, and explore the environment. This project serves as a foundation for future features like block interactions, terrain generation, and more.

## Features

- Basic chunk generation
- Free-fly camera movement
- Mouse-controlled look-around
- Block Textures
- OpenGL Rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)
- A compatible code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/))

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voxel-engine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd voxel-engine
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Controls

- **W**: Move forward
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move backward
- **D**: Move right
- **Space**: Ascend
- **Shift**: Descend
- **Mouse**: Look around

## Roadmap

- Add block interaction (e.g., placing and removing blocks)
- Implement advanced terrain generation (biomes, caves, etc.)
- Optimize rendering performance
- Add multiplayer support
- Expand controls and UI features
